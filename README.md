# Roxy
Roxy is the source code of a modified version of q-bot
Roxy was seemly produced by @fuaming. @oplollie and @uqtss this variant has some of jokers source code on the cnc.c file as well as public scripts and amp methods. This net also has a killer function to stop infected devices from saturating and being rooted multiple times.
